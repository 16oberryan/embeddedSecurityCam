# Embedded Security Cam
This project implements a security camera with motion detection recording via Motion. It includes the ability to move the camera with servos and livestream video directly to a phone using Blynk (for security purposes, the streaming is toggleable). It can also send email notifications through ifttt, which can also be toggled via Blynk.
